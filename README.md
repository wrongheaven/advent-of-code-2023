# JavaScript Solutions for Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains JavaScript solutions for the Advent of Code 2023.

## Getting Started

To test these solutions with your own inputs, you need to add an `input` folder at the root of the project. Each input file should be named as double-digit day numbers (01, 02, ..., 25) and should be in .txt format. Place these files inside the `input` folder.

## Running the Solutions

Each solution can be run independently. The command should be in the format `node days/<DD>.js`, where `<DD>` is the double-digit day number. For example, for day 5, you would run:
```bash
$ node days/05.js
```

After running the script, you should see output in the following format:
```
Day X Part 1: 12345
Day X Part 2: 23456
```

If a problem does not have a solution, it is not because the problem is unsolvable, but because I have not yet come up with a solution. In such cases, the output for that problem will be null.

Please note that these solutions are provided as is and may not be the most optimized solutions.

Happy Coding!
